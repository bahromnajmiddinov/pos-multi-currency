# Multi-currency fields are on existing models (pos.config, pos.payment, pos.payment.method, res.currency)
# No new models are introduced, so no new access rules are strictly needed.
# The fields inherit the access of their parent models.
# This file is kept for future extensibility (e.g. a pos.multi_currency.rate.override model).
